IPC                     The incremental principal component can handle
                        online data sets with highly correlated.
OPC                     The online principal component method refers to
                        the IPC method with the best performance among
                        the IPC, the PPC and the SAPC methods.
PC                      The traditional principal component method.
                        This method can estimate the eigen space of the
                        data set.
PPC                     The perturbation principal component can handle
                        online data sets with highly correlated.

SAPC                    The stochastic approximation principal
                        component can handle online data sets with
                        highly correlated.
SOPC                    The sparse online principal component can not
                        only process online data sets, but also obtain
                        a sparse solution of online data sets.
SPC                     The sparse principal component can obtain
                        sparse solutions of the eigenmatrix to better
                        explain the relationship between principal
                        components and original variables.
